# Interactive-BNN-Medical-Diagnosis-Simulation
Generate a Python script that creates a conceptual simulation of your Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) scenario. This code won't build a full, complex BNN, but it will simulate its key behavior: making a prediction and, crucially, estimating its own uncertainty based on how "typical" the patient data is.
